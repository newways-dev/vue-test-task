**A small Vue.js blog layout built as a test task**

*This project was implemented as a test assignment for the company QTIM to learn Vue basics and build a simple template blog.*

## 📖 About

**Vue Test Task** is a small single-page blog layout built with Vue.js.

The goal of the assignment was to:

- get familiar with **Vue basics** (components, props, data, templates);
- practice working with a **modern frontend toolchain** (Vue CLI, npm/yarn scripts);
- build a **simple template blog** with a posts list and clean UI.

This is not a production project, but a compact learning exercise that shows how I approached Vue from scratch and structured a small blog page.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

During this test task the focus was on:

- 🧩 **Component-based UI** – splitting the blog into reusable pieces (layout, header, post list, post item, etc.)
- 🔄 **Data binding & reactivity** – rendering posts from data instead of hardcoded markup
- 🧵 **Props & one-way data flow** – passing data into child components
- 🧱 **Basic layout & styling** – simple, readable blog layout with standard HTML + CSS
- 🛠 **Working with Vue CLI** – running dev server, building production bundle, linting
